  "p1": "RoomStage is a platform created as a bachelor's thesis within the specialization Graphic and Digital Media - Multimedia Production - New Media Development at Artevelde University of Applied Sciences.",
  "p2": "The goal of this platform is to make online music performances more enjoyable and provide more ways to interact between artists and viewers.",
  "p3": "The platform is intended to be an \"extra layer\" on top of the standard livestream experience. It uses YouTube URLs that point to YouTube livestreams. Artists are expected to go live on YouTube, and use the URL of that livestream to create a show on RoomStage.",
  "p4": "Artists can create polls, view song requests and general chat messages, adjust show settings, moderate the show, etc.",
  "p5": "Participants can vote on polls, make song requests, and chat in general or separate chat rooms. These separate chat rooms can be created by participants, after which they can invite other participants.",
  "p6": "A participant can only request a limited amount of songs (set by the owner of the show). Other participants can then vote on these, which gives the owner of the show insight into which songs the participants would like to hear the most.",
